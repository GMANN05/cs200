[[Hedy Lamarr]]
[[Claude Shannon]]
[[Dr. Michael J. Marcus]]


:: Claude Shannon {"position":"500,400","size":"100,100"}
Claude Shannon was an American mathematician and computer Scientist. He conceived and laid the foundations for the information theory. This included the electronic communications networks that we all use daily.

:: Final Outcome {"position":"900,700","size":"100,100"}
Dr. Marcus also took action on topics such as ultrawindband and MVDDS, which we all use today. Also he was able to get the "reserved" waves like he had hoped to get at the start. Also the main thing you should think him for is his major role in making WIFI what it is today.

:: Hedy Lamarr {"position":"600,700","size":"100,100"}
Hedy Lamarr was an Austro-Hungarian actor and inventor who played a big role in how the Allied torpedos hit their mark. First she was a very popular actor in not just America but also in Czechoslavakia.

:: Her Innovation {"position":"600,800","size":"100,100"}
Hedy Lamarr played a huge role in how accurate torpedos are today. The idea of radio guided torpedos had already been around, however people were worried that the enemy would be able to jam them. Lamarr though of the idea to have a frequency hopping torpedo that would be harder to jam. Many online reports state that this invention helped with the creation of WIFI, bluetooth, GPS, and cellphones.

:: How he Was Invovled in Radio {"position":"1200,400","size":"100,100"}
Brinkley played a big role in the early stages of radio with the making of his own station. He first saw the impact of radio when he toured a station in Los Angeles and saw how powerful it would be to advertise. At the time however, advertising was highly discouraged, this did not stop Brinkley. His first station he made was called "Kansas First, Kansas Best",  he used a 1 kilowatt transmitter for this station. This radio was so popular that he made so much money he installed better sewage, sidewalks, electricity, and even appartments for his patients and employees.  Mexico gave Brinkley a 50,000 watt transmitter for his new radio station. This did not last long as a couple months later it was boosted to 150,000 watts, and then 1 million watts. Some saying that on a clear night you could hear it all the way up into Canada.

:: Impact of  Shannon {"position":"500,300","size":"100,100"}
Claude Shannon has had a major impact on many people's lives. Hes had a massive impact on computer science as a whole. He is even regarded as a founding father in electronic communication. From AI, to probability, to statistics he has made a major impact on each of these.

:: John Romulus Brinkley {"position":"1100,400","size":"100,100"}
John Romlulus Brinkley was an American "doctor" that did some interesting things. Hwoever he did do some things with Radio that was a big step for the time.

:: Shannon / Hartley Theorem {"position":"400,400","size":"100,100"}
This theorem stated the maximum rate at which information can be transfered over a single channel depending on what type of communication it is. You would find the channel capacity, the highest rate at which data can be communicated with low error, using the Signal Power.

:: Spread Spectrum Principle {"position":"500,500","size":"100,100"}
The principle of Spread Spectrum was mainky used in the military world with communications. This would spread the signal of the message over many different frequencies. Making it harder for enemies to listen in on the messages that you are sending. Also it increased the resistance of the sounds to outside noise, natural interference, and jamming.

:: The Way he Changed How Radio Was Goverened {"position":"1100,500","size":"100,100"}
Brinkley's radio station actually made the US make a Brinkley Act in 1932. This made it to where any station live in the United States could not be connected to a transmitter in Mexico. Brinkley's radio station was connected via international phone lines to his transmittors in Mexico.

:: War Support {"position":"700,700","size":"100,100"}
Hedy Lamarr was so popular in the US that during the war she would go around selling war bonds. The way she did this is shw would have someone in the crowd she knew. She then called him up and started to flirt with him and asked the crowd if they should kiss. Lamarr would then ask for the crowd to buy bonds to see this. It clearly worked because it is estimated that around $25 million  worth of bonds were sold.

:: What he Suggested We Do {"position":"1100,700","size":"100,100"}
He suggested that instead of the government piccking winners and losers when it came to who got to use the radio waves, we regulate open waves. This allowed others to use it and claim the waved instead of the government getting to pick who gets what. 

[[Back->Dr. Michael J. Marcus]] 


:: What he Was Known For {"position":"1100,300","size":"100,100"}
The main thing that Brinkley was known for was his interest surgery. This surgery would cure 27 different things!! The main ones he would advertise is fertility, however it could aso cure dementia and even spinal cord tumors. This brought hundreds of people in wanting this magical surgery that would make thier life 10x better. Little did they know all he did was put goat parts into them, with males he would replace their testicles with goat testicles. With women that came in he would replace their uterus with a goats uterus. Its safe to say that people quickly noticed that none of these claims were actually true.

The main thing that Hedy Lamarr was known for at the beginning was her acting. She had starred in many well known movies, one being the very controversial Ecstasy. She started her career over in Czechoslavakia and then Moved over to London. Eventually she made her way over to hollywood where she would become very popular
